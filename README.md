# CovidSafe
This project allows for people to get vaccinated more easily.

Possible Divisions:

Let's try to split up this project into front-end and back-end. People working on the front-end will probably need to figure out a way for the user to 
interact with the app in a seamless way, it'll be partially artistic too. There'll likely be two different kinds of profiles. (1) People who want vaccines. 
(2) People who a re administering vaccines. The administator profiles should have the capability of inputting location and being able to choose it on a map - this 
is because users who want to go to a certain location will probably use Google Maps to get there. Users should be able to allow location services to be enabled 
and have this filter out locations.

Back-end will likely focus on how to store user and administrator information - if anyone knows of a (good = free up to a decent amount of stored information) 
server to use that is not too complicated to use with iOS that is great. Back-end people will have to figure out how to communicate with the server to get the 
administrator's profiles updated so that users who claim vaccine vacancies can actually formally claim the spot.


Coding Style:

Please try to follow reasonable coding style guidelines that way we can all read each other's code - use comments, good spacing, function descriptions and 
modularity i.e. breaking up your code so that each function has a one, clear purpose.


Git Style:

Please try to keep a fairly recent copy of your code on Git. This way people don't try to work with outdated code. Also, please update everyone before you resolve a Git conflict because you could accidentally rewrite the whole repository. When you make commits, please give a bit of high-level explanation regarding the changes you made.
